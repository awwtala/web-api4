# Web APIs: Personal Blog

## Description

This project is an for an individuals personal first blog. It is created so an individual can enter their name, title and contact, which will appear on the following page. This was done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

To create this project, I began with creating the two html, index and blog. The index and html both consist of a head, body, and main. The index.html will have the first page that will present you with the picture, and the fill out form. The fill-out form contains the username, title, and contact.
The blog.html was consist of the first blog page. Which will present to you with the information that the individual has answered.

Following, three CSS pages were created. Blog, form, and style. The form.css is connected to the index.html, the blog.css is connected to blog.html, and style.css is connected to both.
The form.css and blog.css has styling that consist of borders, margin, padding, etc. To give the page a style and a great look. The style.css will have the the background color, font, and the button color that both of the pages share.

At last, three Javascript pages were created: blog.js, form.js, and logic.js. Blog.js is connected to blog.css and blog.html. form.js is connected to form.css and index.html. logic.js is connected to both.

blog.js we created a function for a back button, retrieved blog data from local storage, added an event listener, created elements for each blog post, and appended elements to the blog post and main container.

forms.js a submit button was made, a function to capture the users input from the form to the web page, created a blog form object, retrieving existing Blog Data from Local Storage by using a json, an array, added a new blog post to the array, updated local storage, and cleared the input files.

logic.js contains the mode switching for the dark/light button, and an event listener for changes that can occur.
